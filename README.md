# Archived

Unfortunately, I just don't have time to maintain this project anymore. This repository is now archived, but will remain in place for anyone still using it.

I suggest migrating to the [Caddy 2 Add-on](https://github.com/einschmidt/hassio-addons/tree/master/Caddy%202), which I've been using successfully for several months.

# About

# Installation

Add this repository to your [Hass.io](https://home-assistant.io/hassio/) instance:

Then install the "Caddy" add-on.
